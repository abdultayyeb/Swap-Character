# Swap-Character
This is the code as per the Algorithm to check 2 characters without swap and after that select 2 characters and make it swap.
Basically this is algorithm to swap character after two characters **ABCD** so **AB** will be remain same but **CD** will be swap and it will become **DC** so what ever will be the characters it will swap after two characters.
It should be 4 characters to execute the algorithm.
